Who we are: Team PACT is aimed at supporting women who are underscreened fo cervical cancer, specifically women with physical disabilities. What we do: We are a team of undergraduate students at the University of Michigan working to develop a non-invasive urine collection device for HPV primary testing for cervical cancer screening. This device can be used while sitting down. Who we are looking for: We are looking for a group of potential end users - any woman with a physical disability that will be willing to communicate regularly with us. Why we need your help: We are hoping to have conversations to learn more about how we can develop our design to be more accessible and comfortable. We aim to send our eventual end product to be used by our target end users for further feedback! Contact us: alyssaob@umich.edu, arilayne@umich.edu">
