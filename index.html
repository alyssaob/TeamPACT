    <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Team PACT - Preventive and Accessible Cervical Cancer Testing</p>
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>We are a team of undergraduate students at the University of Michigan working to develop a non-invasive urine collection device for HPV primary testing for cervical cancer screening. Team PACT is an M-HEAL project team formed in fall 2021.</p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to design a cervical cancer screening urine collection device for people with disabilities who are unable or uncomfortable with getting tested by a medical professional. 

        We are working to design a device for individuals to use themselves at home. We are currently prototyping this device using a 3D print and we are looking to make a model using practical materials, followed by testing in a lab and with patients. Designed specifically to accommodate people who have physical disabilities, our device will be more user-friendly than existing devices.</p>
